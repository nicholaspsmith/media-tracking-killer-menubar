# Changelog

Every push to `main` is a release. Before pushing, add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
section at the top with `- ` entries (minor for features, patch for fixes); if an
`## [Unreleased]` section is waiting, turn it into that section. GitHub tags it
and publishes the section as the release notes; a push without one is refused.
Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The full rule:
[StatusItemKit — Releases](https://github.com/nicholaspsmith/StatusItemKit#releases-every-push-is-one).
